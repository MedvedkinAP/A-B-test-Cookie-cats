##### This dataset comprises A/B test outcomes for Cookie Cats, investigating the impact of relocating the initial gate in the game from level 30 to level 40. Upon installing the game, players were randomly assigned to either gate_30 or gate_40.
##### The data we have is from 90189 players that installed the game while the AB-test was running.  The variables are: 
- userid: A unique number that identifies each player
- version: Whether the player was put in the control group (gate_30 - a gate at level 30) or the group with the moved gate (gate_40 - a gate at level 40)
- sum_gamerounds: the number of game rounds played by the player during the first 14 days after install
- retention_1: Did the player come back and play 1 day after installing?
- retention_7: Did the player come back and play 7 days after installing?
